# Air-pollution-monitoring
Arduino-based air quality monitor with MQ-135 sensor. Real-time updates, alerts for high pollution. User-friendly design for easy use and customization.

In response to the pressing issue of air pollution, I've developed a personal air quality monitoring system using Arduino and the MQ-135 gas sensor. This project continuously measures air quality and provides real-time assessments to help me stay informed about the environment I'm in.

Key Features:

Pollutant Detection: The MQ-135 gas sensor detects various pollutants, giving me insights into the air quality around me.

Real-time Monitoring: The system provides continuous, real-time updates on air quality conditions.

Alert System: If air quality exceeds predefined thresholds, the system alerts me, prompting necessary actions like opening windows or avoiding certain areas.

Why Arduino?

User-Friendly: Arduino makes the project user-friendly, allowing even non-experts to monitor air quality effortlessly.

Customization: I can easily modify and expand the system based on my preferences and needs.

This personal project emphasizes simplicity and functionality, providing a practical solution for staying mindful of the air quality in my surroundings.
